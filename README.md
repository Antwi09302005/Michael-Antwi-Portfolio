### Projects

#### Project 1 Title

#### Initial project idea: 

The idea of this project came from wanting the analysis of the pricing of a specific number of items and calculating the data. This project finds the average price of the items, the max price of the items, and the minimum retail price. This data can be used to make price changes and analyze profits. 

#### Tools I used: 

In this project I utilized Microsoft Excel, conditional formatting, excel graphing, and calculations to correctly display the data and display proper profit margin requirements.
Challenges I faced:
One challenge I faced was making sure my graphs correctly displayed the data within the chart. 

#### Other Resources: 

In this project I did not utilize any additional resources.

#### Result:

What did you set out to achieve? Did you achieve it? What improvements would you like to make if you had a chance to take this further? 
In this project the goal was to utilize data of each item and use it to find the average, max, and see if it met the minimum profit requirement. Given the time the improvements I would like to add to this project involve incorporating things such as sales tax and discounts on items.

#### Summary:

This project utilizes the price on items to calculate the average, max, and minimum retail price to see if it reaches profit standards.

#### Initial project idea: 

The idea of this project came from wanting to simulate a personality tester. This project allows an individual to find their personality type based on questions prompted. The projects helps an individual find out the type of personal they are.

#### Tools I used: 

What tools did you use in completing this project? 
In this project I utilized coding software such as Jdoodle and PyCharm to write and test my code. I utilized some python tutorials to fully construct my code and make sure it runs correct and efficiently.

#### Challenges I faced:

When coding this project, the challenge I faced was making sure my code iterated through each of the questions instead of looping on the same question.

#### Other Resources: 

In this project I did not utilize any additional resources.

#### Result:

The goal of this program was to display a personality based on ten questions asked. The code successfully ran and printed out different personality types based on a point system. Given more time I would improve this project by adding more questions and more personality type to make it as specific as possible. 

#### Summary:

This project simulates a personality test by asking the user a series of questions and utilizing a point system to determine which personality type the user has.

#### Initial project idea: 

The idea for this project came from vehicle analytics specifically the car company BMW, to improve profitability. The goal of this project was to identify which vehicles met the profit expectations and which vehicles did not help with vehicle pricing and sales decisions.

#### Tools I used: 

In this project I used Microsoft Excel to organize the data, calculations such as profit margins and vehicle age, conditional formatting to highlight key data, and charting to provide 

#### Challenges I faced:

One challenge I faced was correctly making sure the data was clear and designing an easy-to-understand chart. Another challenge I faced was making sure vehicle age and profits correlated with minimum profit requirement. 

#### Other Resources: 

I used online tutorials on excel formulas and conditional formatting. I did this project independently and referred to a virtual dealership for price data. 

#### Result:

My goal was to make clear data-driven of the BMW dealership profitability. This goal was achieved but with more time Iâ€™d like to connect this chart with real-time databases for updates.

#### Summary:

This project uses Microsoft Excel to check vehicle profitability for a BMW dealership, to help identify vehicles that are not meeting profit expectations while also guiding pricing decisions using data and visualization.
